# Welcome to my dotfiles

This is for personally usage, but you may gladly use it as well. It includes all of my configuration files, but also tweaks for system files which I always include on my system for either responsiveness or gaming tweaks when I have to do fresh installs on new systems.

**Any usage of my configuration files falls in no ways or form under my liability**

## Install

- Configuration/system files are only tested on a fresh install of Arch Linux, so keep that in mind.

- You should have sudo and git installed on your system.

- The scripts only work with systemd-boot.

This project only considers my usage on an AMD machine, you might need to do some tweaking to get it working on your machine.

If you want to use the automatic TKG-kernel installer script you would have to reconfigure it for your system.

Clone this project to your home folder. Run `~/.my-scripts/init/install.sh` and follow the procedures, once done reboot the computer and pray to god that it runs :)
