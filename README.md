My dotfiles are intended for personal usage, but feel free to make use of them as well. They include all of my configuration files, along with tweaks for system files. I always incorporate these tweaks on my system to enhance responsiveness, gaming performance, and security, when setting up new systems.

**Please note that any usage of my system/configuration files is done at your own risk. I am not liable for any consequences that may arise.**

## Install

### Important considerations before installing

- These configuration/system files have only been tested on a fresh install of Arch Linux.

- Keep in mind that this project is designed specifically for my setup on a **Desktop PC** with **AMD** hardware.

### Installation guide

**Warning!** Executing the following steps will replace your existing files with my configuration files.

The install script expects Arch Linux to be setup with `systemd-boot`.

1. Follow the Arch Wiki installation guide up to [section 3.2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide#Chroot).
2. Create an user account, and clone project into your home directory.
3. Run install script as root.
