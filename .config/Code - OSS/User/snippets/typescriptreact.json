	// Place your snippets for typescriptreact here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"React": {
		"prefix": "!react",
		"body": [
			"import React from 'react';",
	 		"",
			"interface $1Props {",
			"  children: React.ReactElement;",
			"}",
			"",
			"export const $1: React.FC<$1Props> = ({ children }) => {",
			"  return <div>{children}</div>;",
			"};"
	 	],
	 	"description": "React Template"
	}
}
